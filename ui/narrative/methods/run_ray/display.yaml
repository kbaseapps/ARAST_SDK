    <p>This is a KBase wrapper for Ray.</p>
    <p>Ray is parallel, graph-based microbial and metagenomic assembler. Ray improves on the vanilla de bruijn graph based algorithm in several aspects: (1) Ray does not stop contig-buiding at the unitigs; rather, it employs greedy heuristics to extend paths. (2) Ray keeps track of the reads from which the k-mers came from and the read pairs from PE reads. (3) Ray uses a repeat removal algorithm inspired by SPAdes. </p>
